Rails Routing Practice
======================

This simple app lets students learning Rails get some practice
understanding how routes from `config/routes.rb` are parsed.

The learner enters some `config/routes.rb`-compliant route descriptions,
and can then enter various routes (method + URI) to see how they would
be recognized and how `params` would be parsed from them.
